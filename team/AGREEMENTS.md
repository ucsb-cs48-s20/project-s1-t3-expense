# Team Agreements

* When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, in advance when possible, as soon as possible afterwards when not.
* We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum.
* Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed.
* We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.
* Atmosphere wise: Relaxed, chill, encouraging.
* If trouble arises, first ask in the team slack, and if no help is provided we can go to the other channels such as 'general' or 'nextjs...' and can be discussed in team meetings if needed (i.e. via Zoom)
* Open communication is key to success, there are no dumb questions. Don't hesitate to bring up new ideas.
