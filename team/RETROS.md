# Retro 04/20/20

* Led by: Kaylee Nguyen
* Present: Roberto Gutierrez, Helen Huang, Dylan Lin, Gregory Baroni, Kobe Shavolian
* Absent:

## Action item

* a goal: Have more proactive communication both inside and outside of class time (lectures and section)
* a change: Assign a rotating leader position for each meeting
* a measurement: See more activity on the slack channel as well as more discussion in meetings.  We can also see if we actually hold Friday meetings

## Retro Assessment

* Used quick retro template. Shared a google doc and had everyone share their thoughts for each section (what was good so far, what was bad so far, ideas, actions for the future).
* Everyone expressed what worked for the team and what needed improvement. Didn't have much to say since this was our first retro and we haven't really started the bulk of the work (coding). There will definitely be more to discuss in future retros.
* Have a plan on how to run the retro and encourage everyone to speak up to express how they feel.
