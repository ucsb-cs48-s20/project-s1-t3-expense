# Retro 04/20/20

* Led by: Kaylee Nguyen
* Present: Roberto Gutierrez, Helen Huang, Dylan Lin, Gregory Baroni, Kobe Shavolian
* Absent:

## Action item

* a goal: Have more proactive communication both inside and outside of class time (lectures and section)
* a change: Assign a rotating leader position for each meeting
* a measurement: See more activity on the slack channel as well as more discussion in meetings.  We can also see if we actually hold Friday meetings

## Retro Assessment

* Used quick retro template. Shared a google doc and had everyone share their thoughts for each section (what was good so far, what was bad so far, ideas, actions for the future).
* Everyone expressed what worked for the team and what needed improvement. Didn't have much to say since this was our first retro and we haven't really started the bulk of the work (coding). There will definitely be more to discuss in future retros.
* Have a plan on how to run the retro and encourage everyone to speak up to express how they feel.

# Retro 05/11/20

* Led by: Helen Huang
* Present: Roberto Gutierrez, Kaylee Nguyen, Dylan Lin, Gregory Baroni, Kobe Shavolian

## Action Item

* A goal: better organization with the use of kanban board
* A change: Start using the kanban board and update/check it regularly
* A measurement: see if we actually put cards in “in progress, review, done” column (more activity); take a screenshot of the current one and compare to the one in the future

## Retro Assessment

* Used the quick retro template (good/bad/improvements) and utilized a Google Doc for everyone to put in ideas before we started discussing them
* Had a lot to discuss compare to the first retro as we started the coding process; Had a great discussion on the ideas we wrote down and everyone seems to agreed on the same things, therefore, we also had some great ideas for future improvement
* Go through the ideas written down first before start team discussion so that you can organize them first and merge/put together some similar ideas

# Retro 05/26/20

* Led by: Kobe Shavolian
* Present: Roberto Gutierrez, Kaylee Nguyen, Dylan Lin, Gregory Baroni, Helen Huang

## Action Item

* Goal: More clarity with our projects and within our team
* Change: Refactor the code, add comments where needed in previously finished code, clarify the kanban board (add comments as well)
* Measurement: See if we make good use of the kanban board, if we can add more components, if the code becomes neater (compare the old codes with new ones in commits)

## Retro Assessment

* Utilized a google docs as well as a new retro method of the 4 L's. Everyone was encouraged to write down at least one bullet comment under each category
* There was a discussion before the retro to help lighten the mood with a rose and thorn, we also had to discuss each comment we wrote down to help get across any ideas
* We felt that communication and clarification with the group was key to getting the final project across
* Code refactoring and add commenting to help make the code readable
