## Brief description of MVP

An app that allows a user to create a bill and place-holder names for the other house members.
Once the bill is created, the user can choose how to split the bill.
When the bill is considered 'paid', the bill then become a receipt and can be viewed later.

* Team has completed production app placeholder

## MVP Status

* Team is on track to complete all stories for MVP by noon a week from Thursday (05/07/2020)

(If applicable, include items below.)

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:
* Connecting mongoDB
* Adding a bill component
* Figuring out the math to split a bill

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP
* Lab/lecture on mongoDB (maybe based on how to connect mongo in the code and save data to the database)
